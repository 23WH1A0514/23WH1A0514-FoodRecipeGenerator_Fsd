# 🍽️ Food Recipe Generator – Full Stack Application

## 📖 Overview
The Food Recipe Generator is a full-stack web application that helps users generate and explore food recipes based on ingredients or user input. The application provides recipe details such as ingredients and cooking instructions through an interactive and user-friendly interface.
